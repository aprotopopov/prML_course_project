We will consider data about human activity recognition research. You could take a look to [short description](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)   of dataset or to [full article](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/public/papers/2013.Velloso.QAR-WLE.pdf)

The goal of our project is to predict the manner in which our participants did the exercise.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
train <- read.csv("~/data_science/prML/pml-training.csv")
test <- read.csv("~/data_science/prML/pml-testing.csv")
```

First approach:

```{r full_model, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
fitMod <- train(factor(classe) ~ ., data=train, method="gbm", model=F)
```


To be continued...

Codes. 

```{r full_model, eval=FALSE}
